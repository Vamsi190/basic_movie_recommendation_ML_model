    "#machine learning tutorials \n",
    "# def : we build a model and give it lots of data, In our model we give the model tens of thousands of pictures of apples , oranges , mangos and pineapple\n",
    "#Now the model will find and learn patterns in the input data\n",
    "\n",
    "#Once the learning is done, when we give it a new picture of a mango that it hasn't seen before and risk it if it is an apple or mango or a pineapple, it will tell us the result with a certain level of accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#Machine learning Pipeline:\n",
    "#1. Import the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Data is typically imported in the form of a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you have a database with lots of data, you can simply export that data and store it in a CSV file for the purpose of our machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 Clean the data:\n",
    "# Remove duplicates as it can confuse the model and make it think certain patterns are more important than they really are, leading to worse\n",
    "# predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handle missing values to ensure the model has complete informaton.\n",
    "#Identify and remove extreme values that can distort the model's learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#For eg : if you are training a model to predict people's height, most peope are between 4 and 7 feet tall, but if there's a data point showing someone\n",
    "# is 20 feet tall, it is likely a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Make text data consistent by converting to lowercase removing punctuationand eliminating extra spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Split the data into training/ test set\n",
    "# Now that we have a clean data set, we need to split it into two segments - one for training the model and one for testing one for it.\n",
    "#For example, if we have a 1000 pictures of apples and mangoes, we can reserve 80% of it training the model and the other 20% for testing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 Create a model:\n",
    "# This involves selecting an algorithm to analyse the data\n",
    "# There are many machine learning algorithms to pick - such as decision trees, neural network and so on.\n",
    "# Each algorithm has it's pro's and cons in terms of accuracy and performance.\n",
    "# So algo you will choose depends on the kind of problem you are trying to solve and your input data.\n",
    "# The good news is that we do not have to program an algorithm ourselves, There are libraries out there provide you with the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#5 Train the model:\n",
    "# We train the model by feedin it our training data.\n",
    "# Our model will then look for patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Make predictions\n",
    "# Once the model is trained, we can ask it to make predictions \n",
    "# In our example of apples and mangoes, we can ask our model to predict, if a given fruit picture is an apple or mango.\n",
    "# Now the model will try to make a prediction\n",
    "# The prediction may not be always accurate. In fact, at the beginning, it is very likely it will give wroong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Evaluate and Improve:\n",
    "# So we have to evaluate the predictions and measure the accuracy.\n",
    "# If the accuracy scores are low, we either have to:\n",
    "  # - Select a different algorithm that will produce a more accurate result for the problem that we are trying to solve or,\n",
    "  # - Fine-tune the parameters of our model. Each model has parameters that you can modify to optimise the accuracy. \n",
